# multi-generational-wealth-transfer

A Clarity smart contract designed for secure, transparent, and flexible wealth transfer across generations with progressive unlock mechanisms.

## Overview

This smart contract implements a sophisticated wealth transfer system with age-based unlocks, achievement-based incentives, decentralized identity verification, and emergency fund provisions. It's designed to help families preserve and responsibly transfer wealth across generations while encouraging personal development and financial responsibility.

## Standout Features

### Progressive Unlock Mechanism

The contract implements a tiered release schedule that gradually gives beneficiaries access to their inheritance:

- **Age-based Release Schedule**: Funds are unlocked at predefined age milestones (e.g., 18, 21, 25, 30, etc.)
- **Decentralized Identity Verification**: Uses DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers) to verify beneficiary identity securely
- **Achievement-triggered Unlocks**: Additional funds can be unlocked when beneficiaries reach specific life milestones or achievements
- **Emergency Fund Provision**: A portion of the inheritance is set aside for emergencies, accessible through a governance approval process
